- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


    I came into class on our snow day to begin A3. This was extremely necessary because I could not get Java to run at first (Thank you Ab for helping 
    me figure out the problem!) Java is definitly more difficult for me than Python just in the sense that it's less intuitive. For example I kept writing
    "print()" when I wanted to print something, getting confused as to how a simple print didn't work, and then realizing I had to write the whole 
    "System.out.println()" out. It, of course, wasn't a serious issue, but still it was annoying how often it happened. However, the two programming
    languages, despite their differences, do have generally the same functions (they are capable of doing the same things). I feel like it's very valuable
    to know several programming languages -- especially for later in your career -- but at my current level it's mostly stylistically not functionally different.
    I would advice new students to just take it slow, learning a new language is incremental and w3schools is there for a reason!
